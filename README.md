## Project Statement:
Our parking space finder application aims to facilitate the parking process at the American University in Cairo by helping students locate the nearest empty parking slot. The parking lot will be divided into lanes, each lane having a specified name. Whenever a student parks in a specific lane, the student will then choose from the application the lane he/she parked in. The application will then increment the number of parked cars in a specific lane. This will update a database containing the number of parked cars per lane and display it on the application thus showing when a lane is full. Since the process of finding a parking spot has become more complicated with the growing number of cars. This mobile application is the need of the hour which will help people and save their time.
