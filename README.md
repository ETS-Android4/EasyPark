## Project Description:
Our parking space finder application aims to facilitate the parking process at the American University in Cairo by helping students and faculty locate the nearest empty parking slot. Whenever a student parks in a specific parking space, the student will then choose from the application the space he/she parked in. The application will then increment the number of parked cars in a specific space. This will update a database containing the number of parked cars per space and display it on the application thus showing when a space is full. We will also provide the users with the ability to report the parking status of the parking spaces, and we will use both sources of information to get an estimate of the true status of the parking space. Moreover, we will be validating the location of the users when they use the application in order to gurantee that the application is not misused and gurantee the validity of the information reaching our database. Another feature we are providing our users with is the ability to view each parking space on google maps with a pinpoint indicating its location as well as the ability to navigate to the parking space location. In addition, in order to incentivise our users to use the application, we will grant them points for each time they use the application in an approperiate manner. They can later redeem these points for offers from vendors around the AUC. In order to ease the process of creating an account, we are using firebase to allow the user to reate their accounts with google sign in. Since the process of finding a parking spot has become more complicated with the growing number of cars. This mobile application is the need of the hour which will help people and save their time.
